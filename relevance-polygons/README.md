# Relevance polygons

These polygons were used to determine which crashes we should request data for from MVPD. To determine which crashes occurred at locations intersecting with data from each layer, we used Vector>Geoprocessing>Intersection in QGIS.

driveway-rectangles had 24 crashes and needs-more-info-polygons had 45 crashes. This totaled to 69 crashes that we requested. non-driveway-polygons had the remaining 176 crashes, which we did not request.
