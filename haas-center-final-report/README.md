# Final report for the Haas Center for Public Service

## Name
Evan Baldonado (he/him) — enb

## Placement host/organization
The city of Mountain View, Public Works Department

## Dates of service
- July 5th, 2022 – September 9th, 2022
- This continued work from June 13th, 2022 – July 1st, 2022, which continued work from spring quarter, AY 2021–2022.

## Two-sentence project summary
We selected a project started as part of a community-engaged learning course for continued support over the summer. The student is researching the relationship between local tree canopies and traffic safety, specifically automobile-pedestrian crashes, by analyzing detailed data from local law enforcement incident reports and automating the process to map this data by location, time of day, and daylight conditions. — Shoshanah Cohen (project advisor from Haas)

## Skills, self-awareness, values, or behavior gained
Technical skills: I worked extensively with GIS (including [ArcGIS online](https://www.arcgis.com/), [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org), and [PyQQIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html)). This included formatting data, mapping datapoints, applying filters to data, and writing custom Python scripts to interact with QGIS. I also wrote a number of Python scripts to wrangle data, make workflows more efficient and accurate, and more. I used Python libraries such as [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (interacting with PDFs), [Meteostat](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (weather data), and [astral](https://pypi.org/project/astral/) (sunset times), [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [geographiclib](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/Python/2.0/) (distance calculations), and [QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/) (user input for drawing polygons), along with a number of more common libraries/modules. In addition, I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and Google Sheets/Microsoft Excel to visualize data.

Research skills: I collected, analyzed, and summarized data (including vehicle–pedestrian crashes, tree locations, property addresses, driveway locations, public input, and official documents such as city codes/ordinances and standard plans/details). I also gained experience with statistical sampling.

Communication skills: I created multiple summary documents of public input on various projects. This involved synthesizing different sources, visualizing data, and packaging everything up into easily understandable documents.

Work: I got to experience working for city government, both in-person and remotely. This was a very enjoyable experience overall, and I plan to continue this work during fall quarter, AY 2022–2023.

## Challenges
Open-ended tasks: Oftentimes, I was given a problem to solve with the expectation that I would figure out how to solve it myself. For example, I was asked to quantify the impacts on trees of Mountain View policy. I ended up writing a script to randomly sample addresses from Mountain View and another to draw driveway triangles for analysis. Another example of my work in response to open-ended tasks included using Figma to visualize driveway sight triangle policies in Santa Clara. This openness required me to think about the bigger picture, which could be challenging at times. It also allowed me to flourish creatively, which I enjoyed.

GIS: I lacked significant prior experience with GIS. First I had to weigh between the alternatives for my computer. I first experimented with ArcGIS Online but eventually landed on QGIS because I could install it as an app and it appeared to have more functionality. I ran into a number of issues and bugs, including some related to rendering and rotating polygons such as driveway sight triangles. I ended up writing a custom Python script with PyQGIS to draw triangles. This required lots of reading documentation and troubleshooting.

## Value and impact
I found this summer to be a very valuable experience! I was able to experience working for city government, both in-person and remotely. I was also able to put my programming skills to use to address a large and open-ended question. I believe my work is important to Mountain View and that it has the potential to inform policy around driveway sight triangles, both in Mountain View and elsewhere. My work will also improve Mountain View's future collection of public input around certain projects, which will save the city time and resources while allowing employees to collect and summarize data effectively. This will allow the public to have an even greater say in their local government's projects.

## Thank yous
Thank you to Brandon Whyte, my project supervisor from Mountain View and to Shoshanah Cohen, my project advisor from the Haas Center. This project would not have been possible without Brandon’s guidance and expertise, including an excellent vision of both the bigger picture and specific tasks, or without Shoshanah’s advising and support, including helping find me last-minute funding. Thank you :)
