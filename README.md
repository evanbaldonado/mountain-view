# City of Mountain View (Summer 2022)
This is a monorepo for my work with the city of Mountain View over summer 2022.

I was an hourly employee for the [city of Mountain View's Public Works Department](https://www.mountainview.gov/depts/pw/default.asp) (Transportation Division) from Monday, June 13th to Friday, July 1st. I received a stipend from Stanford University's [Haas Center for Public Service](https://haas.stanford.edu/) to continue this work remotely from Tuesday, July 5th to Friday, September 9th.

For my final reports, see [mountain-view-final-report](mountain-view-final-report) and [haas-center-final-report](haas-center-final-report). The Mountain View report goes more into detail about the specifics of my work, while the Haas Center report focuses more on my takeaways from the summer.
